Course Type: SISSA PhD Course

Academic Year: 2020-2021

Period: February - April

Research Group: 
Mathematical Analysis, Modelling, and Applications
mathLab

Description: 

This course provides a high level overview on the numerical solution of partial differential equations. All major classes of numerical methods will be analysed within a rigorous mathematical setting. Key aspects, such as consistency and stability, will be thoroughly investigated, providing the guidelines for the correct choice and implementation of numerical methods for a range of problems.

The lectures will be completed by a series of guided problems for testing in practice the numerical algorithms and their properties, helping everyone to build their own suits of simulation codes. 

This course is suitable for students pursuing a research career in numerical analysis as well as students that may just use PDE models in their research.
